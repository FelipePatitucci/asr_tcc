  - ASR:
      - Automatic Speech Recognition
  - MFCC:
      - Mel Frequency Cepstral Coeffiecient (Davis and Mermelstein - 1980's)
  - Cepstral:
      - In Fourier analysis, the cepstrum is the result of computing the 
      inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the logarithm of the estimated signal spectrum.
  - Signal Spectrum (Spectral Density):
      - The power spectrum  of a continuous time signal describes 
      the distribution of power into frequency components composing that signal.
  - Periodogram:
    - Is an estimate of the spectral density of a signal.
  - STFT (NFFT):
    - Short-Time Fourier-Transform (N-point FFT)
  - NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization):
    - Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix factorization technique
