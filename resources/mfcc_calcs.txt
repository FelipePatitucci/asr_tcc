Frame the signal into short frames.
[Apply a window function such as the Hamming window to each frame]
For each frame, do STFT and calculate the periodogram estimate of the power spectrum.
Apply the mel filterbank to the power spectra, sum the energy in each filter.
Take the logarithm of all filterbank energies.
Take the DCT of the log filterbank energies. (used to decorrelate the coefficients)
Keep DCT coefficients 2-13 (num_ceps), discard the rest.
[One may apply sinusoidal liftering1 to the MFCCs to de-emphasize higher MFCCs]
